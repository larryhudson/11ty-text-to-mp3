Hi Claire!

Woo hoo

Definitely +1 to Kunok's statement. In the rest of my code I only make code more complex when it's a bottleneck where the speed really matters. Why wouldn't I apply that principle to file reading? In many parts of many programs code simplicity/readability can be more important than execution speed. If it's a bottleneck area I'll use async methods to keep from stopping further code execution. Otherwise...sync is great. Don't blindly hate sync.

Yeah I guess so!
